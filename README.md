ðŸš€ Project Showcase: Exploratory Data Analysis on Diwali sale

I'm thrilled to share my latest Exploratory data analysis project, where 
I explored the e-commerce company diwali sale dataset and find
 valuable insights about the product sale. This project provided 
hands-on experience in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and
 visualization, helping to translate raw data into actionable insights. 
 Hereâ€™s a snapshot of what I accomplished

 Analyzed 10,000+ sales records to identify top-performing product categories (e.g., Electronics: 35% revenue share).

Evaluated promotional campaign ROI, linking a 15% sales increase to targeted discounts during peak hours.

Created interactive dashboards to visualize trends, enabling stakeholders to optimize future campaign budgets
